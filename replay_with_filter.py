"""
replay_with_filter.py — Show which existing positions would have been rejected
by the new max_slippage_for_entry filter, and the PnL impact.

Reads paper_trades.jsonl + paper_state.json and computes for each entry:
    signed_slip = (exec - mid) * direction
If > 2¢, filter would have rejected.

For closed trades we know the actual PnL — easy.
For open positions we can't know final PnL, but we report current state.
